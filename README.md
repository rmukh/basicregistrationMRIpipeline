# basicregistrationMRIpipeline
The basic structural and diffusion MRI registration with pre-processing pipeline in Python.

# BIDS format
The pipeline will attempt to convert DICOM files to gzipped NIFTI file format with the highest compression and try to organize them based on the input dataset folder structure. The program will be asking you questions to determine folders or filenames responsible for different MRI modalities (T1, T2, DWI). However, if it doesn't work correctly, please make sure to organize your dataset in a BIDS format first and then re-run the program.
I can recommend a few utilities that might help you.
